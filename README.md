Who is my User?

	target a couple who are in need of date night trivia game night.

What is their pain point?

	Covid hit relationships hard and we are in need of some at home date nights fun.
    When thinking of their next date night most people think "Oh, let's do a movie... it's quick and easy and perfect". Need to switch it up? Is it your millionth time watching a movie? Why not try trivia game night? 

How do they use our solution to overcome this problem?

	The couple starts the app and will be greeted with â€œ Welcome! Enjoy this time with your significant other and play some trivia!"
	Then they will later be asked on one of 3 basic genres or an All topic, level extreme. 
	
	Are you the couple to face adversity and come back stronger with your communication skills? Will you beat that ultimate challenge?
	
	At the end you will be told how many you got right out of 18 questions. 

	Remember this isn't Monopoly, no flipping tables!
