# DateNightTrivia

Date Night Trivia is a CLI trivia game used to target couples who are looking for date ideas. 

Let's be serious, Covid hit relationships hard and we are in need of some at home date night fun. When thinking of their next date night, most people think, "Oh, let's do a movie... it's quick and easy". Need to switch it up? Is it your millionth time watching a movie? Why not try trivia game night? 

The couple starts the app and will be greeted with “Welcome! Enjoy this time with your significant other and play some trivia!"
Then they will later be asked "Are you ready for some trivia? Type 'y' to continue or if you wish to exit, type 'n'"
After you will go through 20 random questions, either multiple choice or T/F. To enter you answer, enter the number the answer corresponds to.

At any moment you wish to exit the application, type 'exit'. This will print out your final score and say a farewell. 

So are you the couple to face adversity and come back stronger with your communication skills? Will you beat the trivia challenge?

At the end you will be told how many you got right out of 20 questions - final score. 

Remember this isn't Monopoly, no flipping tables!
