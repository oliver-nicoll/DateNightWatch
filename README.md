Who is my User?

	target a couple who are in need of date night movie ideas.

What is their pain point?

	Covid hit relationships hard and we are in need of some at home date nights.
    When thinking of their next movie date night, they look for certain genres of a movie but ultimately they look for something they both will enjoy. Nothing better than Disney classics.

How do they use our solution to overcome this problem?

	The couple starts the app and will be greeted with “Hello, type in the genre of the kind of movie you're looking for!"
	Once input is entered, they will be propted with “Great choice, now do you wish to see the synoptsis or go back? ”
	
	The couple chooses a potential movie but can go back and see the descriptions of other ones they might be interested in.
